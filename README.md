Cash - Crap, Another SHell

Why Cash?
===
-
Cash started out as a learning tool for myself to explore 
and learn more about shells, C, and programming in a Linux environment. 
When I couldn't stop adding features to it and kept coming back for more,
I decided to release it into the wild and let my fellow hackers and coders 
enjoy it, for better or for worse. I invite you to take it apart, break it, 
add to it, and anything else you might dream up.

As you may have noticed, this is not the best, or most professional code
out there. Feel more than free to email me, send in a patch, or fork it and
show me how it's done. I'll just be glad to learn more, and get more features into Cash.

Features
===
-
History file (Because sometimes you forget) (Done/stable testing)

Logging (Messy/testing)

RC file/customizble startup (in progress/development)

Tab completion (Can't live without it)(in progress/testing. big thanks to xorsema)

Job Control (Because that's what REAL shells do)(Planned)

Scripting (Because it's nice to be lazy) (Far future/Planned)
