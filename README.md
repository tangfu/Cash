Cash - Crap, Another SHell

Why Cash?
===
-
Cash started out as a learning tool for myself to explore 
and learn more about shells, C, and programming in a Linux environment. 
When I couldn't stop adding features to it and kept coming back for more,
I decided to release it into the wild and let my fellow hackers and coders 
enjoy it, for better or for worse. I invite you to take it apart, break it, 
add to it, and anything else you might dream up.

Features
===
-
History file (Because sometimes you forget) (Done/stable testing)

Logging (Messy/testing)

RC file/customizble startup (in progress/development)

Tab completion (Can't live without it)(in progress/testing. big thanks to xorsema)

Job Control (Because that's what REAL shells do)(Planned)

Scripting (Because it's nice to be lazy) (Far future/Planned)
